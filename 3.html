JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
